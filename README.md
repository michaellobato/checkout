Simple purchase list + checkout cart angular app

Select the items you want to buy on the first screen, the second screen has a spot to modify your "cart" and enter your credit card number. If everything is valid, the proceed button will take you to a final thank you screen. I have done very little bootstrap styling in the past so I decided to try it with this. The page obviously leaves MUCH to be desired but and I will work out all of the kinks in time. This is a sloppy, contrived example of a page intended to demonstrate a bit of programming prowess and not design or styling skills.
